## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This is the first stable release of Semantic-STGCNN, representing the culmination of extensive research and development work. Key highlights include:

1. **Production-Ready Code**: Complete refactoring of the original research code into a well-structured, documented, and tested framework.

2. **Reproducible Results**: All experiments can be reproduced using the provided configuration files and scripts.

3. **Academic Standards**: Code follows academic software development best practices with comprehensive documentation and proper citations.

4. **Community Ready**: Open-source release with contribution guidelines and community support infrastructure.

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from earlier versions or adapting from the original research code:

1. **Configuration Changes**: The new version uses YAML configuration files instead of hardcoded parameters.
2. **API Changes**: Model initialization now uses keyword arguments for better clarity.
3. **Data Format**: Dataset loading expects the new standardized format with semantic features.

### Future Roadmap

- **v1.1.0**: Multi-GPU training support and distributed training
- **v1.2.0**: Additional semantic feature types and datasets
- **v1.3.0**: Real-time inference optimization and deployment tools
- **v2.0.0**: Integration with other trajectory prediction frameworks

### Acknowledgments
